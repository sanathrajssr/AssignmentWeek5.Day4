 Java Questions & Answers
1.What Is OOPS Stands For?
           OOPS-Object oriented Programming Language.
               Types
                 * Abstraction
                * Inheritance
               * Polymorphism
              * Encapsulation
2.What is Polymorphism?Explain Types?
       Polymorphism is the ability to process objects differently on the basis of their class and data types.
               Two Types of Polymorphism.
                       * Compile Time Polymorphism.
                       * Run Time  Polymorphism.
3. What is Interface and Example in Java&Selenium?
        * An Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.
       * Interface is a Design.
      * 100% Unimplemented Methods.
  Example in Java.
           * List 
           * Set
           * Collection
  Example in Selenium
         * Webdriver
         * WebElement
          * Search Context
4.What is Abstract Class and Example?
    * Abstract Class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects.
    * Abstract class can only be used in an abstract class,and it does not have a body.
    * It is Partially Implemented.
 Example in Java 
      * Abstract List
      * Abstract Collection
 Example in Selenium
          * By
5.Difference Between Multiple Inheritance and Multilevel Inheritance?
   Multiple Inheritance
        * Multiple Inheritance is when a class inherits from many base classes.
        * Multiple Inheritance is not widely used because it makes the system more complex.
  Multilevel Inheritance
          * Multilevel Inheritance is an inheritance type that inherits from a derived class,making that derived class a base class for a new class.
          * Multilevel Inheritance is widely used.
6.Is Multiple Inheritance possible in Java?
            * The Java Programming language supports multiple inheritance of type.
            * Which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface.
            * An object can have multiple types.
            * The type of its own class and the types of all the interfaces that the class implements.
7.What is Keyword for using inheritance?
         * The extends Keyword extends a class.
         * In Java,it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
8.What is the keyword to connect interface and class?
          * The interface keyword is used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods.
          * The interface must be implemented by another class with the implements keyword.
9.What is the Difference between Class and Interface?
           Class
               * A class describes the attributes and behaviours of an object.
               * A class may contains abstract methods,concrete methods.
           Interface
                * An interface contains behaviours that a class implements.
                * An interface contains only abstract methods.
10.What is the Difference between class and abstract class?
           Class
               *  Class is a Template Used to Create Objects and to define object data Types and Methods.
              * Classes are Categories,and Objects are items Within Each Category.
             Abstract Class
                  *Abstract Class is a Class that is declared Abstract.
                 * It May or or May Not Include Abstract Methods.
                 * Abstract Class Cannot Be Instantiated.
